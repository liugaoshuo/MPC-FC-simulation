## 质子交换膜燃料电池系统控制：综述

### abstract

Although the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is still attracting enormous R&D interest because of its high energy density, its commercialization is hampered by many challenges including cutting cost, improving performance and increasing durability. While they could be solved by material selection, the durability of PEMFC is also affected by voltage reversals and fuel starvation. In this paper, PEMFC control sub-systems namely the reaction, thermal, water management and power electronic subsystems are reviewed critically, with special attention on control strategies to avoid fuel starvation.

Classical proportional integral and derivative (PID) controllers are commonly used in feedback voltage control and feed-forward current control by manipulating hydrogen and air flow rates. Self-tuning PID controllers or sliding mode controllers adapt to changing dynamics and respond faster. Adaptive controllers (AC) such as load governors and extremum seeking controllers update control action continuously. Model predictive control (MPC) uses a PEMFC model to predict system behavior and update controller action. Recently, artificial intelligence such as neural network control (NNC), fuzzy logic control (FLC) and FLC-PID control have been used in PEMFC system control because they are simpler and cheaper to implement without heavy computational burden of the AC and MPC but produce better results.

尽管质子交换膜燃料电池（PEMFC）因其高能量密度仍然吸引着巨大的研发兴趣，但其商业化受到许多挑战的阻碍，包括削减成本、改善性能和提高耐久性。虽然它们可以通过材料选择来解决，但PEMFC的耐久性也会受到电压逆转和燃料饥饿的影响。本文严格审查了PEMFC的控制子系统，即反应、热、水管理和电力电子子系统，并特别关注避免燃料饥饿的控制策略。

经典的比例、积分和导数（PID）控制器通常用于反馈电压控制和前馈电流控制，通过操纵氢气和空气的流量。自调PID控制器或滑动模式控制器能适应不断变化的动态，并且反应更快。自适应控制器（AC），如负载调节器和寻求极值的控制器连续更新控制动作。模型预测控制（MPC）使用PEMFC模型来预测系统行为并更新控制器动作。最近，人工智能如神经网络控制（NNC）、模糊逻辑控制（FLC）和FLC-PID控制已被用于PEMFC系统控制，因为它们更简单、更便宜，没有AC和MPC的沉重计算负担，但能产生更好的结果。

### 1.introduce

In spite of recent discovery of major reserves, fossil fuels are depleting rapidly, and may not be sufficient enough to meet future energy demands, causing an energy demand-supply gap in the near future, which in turn threatens the energy security of the world

尽管最近发现了主要的储量，但化石燃料正在迅速消耗，可能不足以满足未来的能源需求，在不久的将来造成能源供需缺口，这反过来又威胁到世界的能源安全。

In addition, it is beyond doubt that fossil fuels pollute the environment and cause acid rain, global warming and climate change

此外，化石燃料污染环境，导致酸雨、全球变暖和气候变化，这是毫无疑问的。

Many countries and companies have invested heavily on extensive research and development programs in recent years devoted to developing new alternative and renewable energy sources and technology that can bridge current and future energy demand-supply gap in a sustainable way.

近年来，许多国家和公司在广泛的研究和开发项目上投入巨资，致力于开发新的替代和可再生能源和技术，以可持续的方式弥补当前和未来的能源需求-供应差距。

The new energy sources include solar energy, wind energy, hydro power, biomass energy, geothermal energy, nuclear energy and hydrogen energy that also include fuel cell technology.

新能源包括太阳能、风能、水力发电、生物质能、地热能、核能和氢能，也包括燃料电池技术。

Hydrogen energy and fuel cells are the most promising green and clean alternative energy source and energy conversion device respectively of the future because they have low or zero carbon emission and environmental pollution depending on whether hydrogen is produced from non-renewable or renewable primary energy sources respectively, and higher efficiency relative to other alternative and renewable energy sources and energy conversion technology

氢能和燃料电池分别是未来最有前途的绿色清洁替代能源和能源转换装置，因为它们具有低或零碳排放和环境污染的特点，这取决于氢气是由不可再生的还是可再生的一次能源生产的，而且相对于其他替代能源和可再生能源及能源转换技术而言，效率更高。

Fuel cells share many characteristics with batteries since both produce electrical energy efficiently from chemical “fuels” via electrochemical reactions with oxidants, and both require minimum maintenance due to the lack of moving parts

燃料电池与电池有许多共同特点，因为两者都通过与氧化剂的电化学反应从化学 "燃料 "中有效地产生电能，并且由于缺乏移动部件，两者都需要最小的维护。

The main difference between batteries and fuel cells is that the former are energy storage devices whose available energy is determined by the amount of chemical reactant stored in the battery itself, whereas the former are energy conversion devices that produce electrical energy continuously as long as fuel and oxygen are supplied to their electrodes. The main disadvantage of batteries is their limited lifetime, where batteries stop producing electricity when their reactants are depleted or their electrodes are degraded, and must be either recharged or replaced.

电池和燃料电池的主要区别在于，前者是能量储存装置，其可用能量由储存在电池本身的化学反应物的数量决定，而前者是能量转换装置，只要向其电极提供燃料和氧气，就能持续产生电能。电池的主要缺点是其有限的使用寿命，当电池的反应物耗尽或其电极退化时，就会停止发电，必须进行充电或更换。

On the other hand, in fuel cells, reactants such as fuels and oxidants are supplied externally rather than being enclosed within batteries and electrical energy from fuel cells is continuously produced as long as the fuel and oxygen are supplied to it, provided that there is no leakage or corrosion in the fuel cell.

另一方面，在燃料电池中，燃料和氧化剂等反应物是由外部提供的，而不是被封闭在电池内，只要燃料和氧气被提供给它，只要燃料电池中没有泄漏或腐蚀，燃料电池的电能就会持续产生。

In addition, fuel cells are smaller, lighter and easier to refuel than batteries and therefore are easier to implement on a larger scale.

此外，燃料电池比电池更小、更轻、更容易加油，因此更容易在更大范围内实施。

The main aim of this review is to discuss the latest findings and future trends of research and development on the control of the PEMFC systems that is crucial in its commercialization as the cleanest and most efficient energy conversion device for hydrogen energy, a very promising alternative energy of the future

本综述的主要目的是讨论关于PEMFC系统控制的最新研究结果和未来趋势，这对其作为最清洁和最有效的氢能能源转换装置的商业化至关重要，氢能是一种非常有前途的未来替代能源。

The discussion begins with a review of the most common types of fuel cells that have been developed to date and their applications.

讨论首先回顾了迄今为止已开发的最常见的燃料电池类型及其应用。

This is followed by a short discussion on the structure and working principles of the proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) in order to understand how the system can be controlled more effectively.

接下来是对质子交换膜燃料电池（PEMFCs）的结构和工作原理的简短讨论，以了解如何更有效地控制该系统。

Various control strategies that have been implemented for the various PEMFC control sub-systems such as reactants, thermal and water management, and power electronics control subsystems are discussed critically.

对各种PEMFC控制子系统，如反应物、热和水管理以及电力电子控制子系统，已经实施的各种控制策略进行了严格讨论。

Previous reviews focused mainly on the power electronics control subsystem without due  regard to the effect of fuel starvation during sudden current demand on the PEMFC durability and measures to rectify problem

以前的评论主要集中在电力电子控制子系统上，没有充分考虑到突发电流需求时燃料匮乏对PEMFC耐久性的影响以及纠正问题的措施。

The present work closes the gap by reviewing control strategies that have been adopted to address the problem of fuel starvation as a result of sudden current demand, which if not controlled may damage the PEMFC.

本工作通过回顾已经采用的控制策略来解决因突然的电流需求而导致的燃料匮乏问题，从而填补了这一空白，如果不加以控制，可能会损坏PEMFC。

Finally, extensive discussion is carried out on the merits of several control strategies which have been used to avoid fuel starvation in the PEMFC system.

最后，对几种控制策略的优点进行了广泛的讨论，这些策略被用来避免PEMFC系统中的燃料匮乏。

### 2.Fuel cell types and applications

The first “fuel cell” was invented by Sir William Grove more than 150 years ago as a “gaseous voltaic battery”, when he discovered that electricity could be generated by reversing the electrolysis of water using hydrogen and oxygen

第一个 "燃料电池 "是由威廉-格罗夫爵士在150多年前发明的 "气态伏特电池"，当时他发现可以通过使用氢气和氧气反向电解水来产生电力。

The term “fuel cell” was first coined by Mond & Langer nearly half a century later

燃料电池 "一词是由Mond & Langer在近半个世纪后首次提出的。

Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that transform chemical energy in fuels such as hydrogen and methanol into direct current (DC) electricity by electrochemical means with oxygen in the air.

燃料电池是一种电化学装置，它利用空气中的氧气，通过电化学方法将氢和甲醇等燃料中的化学能转化为直流电。

Since the fuel cells process does not involve combustion at all, it is more efficient and quieter than the equivalent-power thermal generator.

由于燃料电池过程完全不涉及燃烧，它比等效功率的热发电机更高效、更安静。

Furthermore, it is also a clean technology because the byproducts of the electrochemical reaction are only water and heat when pure hydrogen is used as the fuel.

此外，当使用纯氢作为燃料时，电化学反应的副产物只有水和热，因此它也是一项清洁技术。

Hence the low chemical, thermal and carbon dioxide emissions of the fuel cells make it a very attractive technology for reducing the carbon emission intensity.

因此，燃料电池的低化学、热和二氧化碳排放使其成为一种非常有吸引力的降低碳排放强度的技术。

The six main types of fuel cells are proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs), phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs) and alkaline fuel cells (AFCs). An emerging fuel cell, the microbial fuel cell (MFCs) is receiving greater interests from fuel cell researchers in recent years.

六种主要的燃料电池是质子交换膜燃料电池（PEMFCs）、直接甲醇燃料电池（DMFCs）、固体氧化物燃料电池（SOFCs）、熔融碳酸盐燃料电池（MCFCs）、磷酸燃料电池（PAFCs）和碱性燃料电池（AFCs）。近年来，一种新兴的燃料电池--微生物燃料电池（MFCs）正受到燃料电池研究人员更大的关注。

The basic designs of fuel cells are nearly identical except for the electrolyte and fuel.

除了电解质和燃料之外，燃料电池的基本设计几乎是相同的。

PEMFCs are by far the most promising fuel cell technology because of their low operating temperature, low noise, quick startup capability, light mass and high power density

PEMFC是迄今为止最有前途的燃料电池技术，因为它具有低工作温度、低噪音、快速启动能力、质量轻和高功率密度等特点。

PEMFCs have been developed for use in small distributed power generators in hospitals, hotels and office buildings because of their compact design (1 kW-5 MW)

pemfc由于其紧凑的设计(1 kW-5 MW)，已被开发用于医院、酒店和办公楼的小型分布式发电机。

They are also used in portable electronic devices such as laptops, mobile phones and video recorders because they are lighter and smaller than batteries, have longer operating and faster response time compared to batteries and do not need recharging from the grid (20-100 mW)

它们也被用于便携式电子设备，如笔记本电脑、移动电话和录像机，因为它们比电池更轻、更小，与电池相比，具有更长的运行时间和更快的响应时间，并且不需要从电网充电(20-100兆瓦)。

However, DMFCs have largely replaced PEMFCs in mobile application in recent years because liquid fuels used in the former such as methanol could be handled more safely and efficiently in small quantities compared to hydrogen.

然而，近年来，dmfc在移动应用中已经在很大程度上取代了pemfc，因为前者使用的液体燃料，如甲醇，与氢气相比，可以在少量的情况下更安全有效地处理。

The most important and potentially large scale application of PEMFCs is in transportation such as in buses, cars and motorcycles because of increasing fossil fuel prices caused by limited fossil fuel availability, and tougher legislations by many countries throughout the world for carbon intensity reduction in transportation (5-500 kW)

PEMFC最重要的和潜在的大规模应用是在交通领域，如公共汽车、汽车和摩托车，因为化石燃料供应有限导致化石燃料价格上涨，以及世界上许多国家对减少交通领域的碳强度制定了更严格的立法（5-500千瓦）。

Although PEMFCs have passed the demonstration phase and are starting to move into the commercialization phase, a wide range of challenges have yet to be overcome before PEMFCs can be commercialized.

尽管PEMFC已经过了示范阶段，并开始进入商业化阶段，但在PEMFC商业化之前，还有一系列广泛的挑战有待克服。

Today, research on PEMFCs focuses mainly on improving PEMFC performance while cutting down cost by reducing the amount of Pt catalyst, developing cheaper alternative  materials for membranes and bipolar plates, performing steadystate system analyses, and hybridizing of the PEMFC system

今天，关于PEMFC的研究主要集中在提高PEMFC的性能，同时通过减少Pt催化剂的用量来降低成本，开发更便宜的膜和双极板的替代材料，进行稳态系统分析，以及对PEMFC系统进行混合。

### 3.Basic structure and working principle of PEMFCs

The basic PEMFC stack consists of **membrane electrode assemblies** (MEAs) that are sandwiched by bipolar plates, sealed by gaskets, encompassed at both ends by current collector plates and secured by several bolts and nuts as shown in Fig.

基本的PEMFC堆栈由 **膜电极组件**（MEAs）组成，它们被双极板夹住，用垫圈密封，两端被集电板包住，由几个螺栓和螺母固定，如图所示。

![](.\PEMFC\basic-structure .png)

The MEAs at the heart of the PEMFC, consist of proton exchange membranes sandwiched by two types of electrodes: anodes and cathodes on either side, where electric power is generated from the electrochemical redox reactions whenever hydrogen and air are supplied

PEMFC的核心MEAs由质子交换膜组成，中间夹着两种电极:两侧是阳极和阴极，每当有氢气和空气供应时，电化学氧化还原反应就会产生电能

The bipolar plates usually made of low porosity polymergraphite composites, distribute hydrogen and air uniformly across the anodes and the cathodes of the MEAs respectively via machine or moulded gas channels or flow fields and conduct electrons through adjoining anodes and cathodes; the latter function giving the plates their name.

双极板通常由低孔隙率聚合物石墨复合材料制成，通过机械或模塑的气通道或流场将氢和空气均匀地分布在MEAs的阳极和阴极上，并将电子通过相邻的阳极和阴极;后者的功能赋予了这些板块名称。

The flow field can be straight, serpentine, parallel, inter-digitated or pinned.

流场可以是直的、蛇形的、平行的、指间的或钉状的。

The gaskets seal the PEMFC stack and prevent the gases from leaking out or inter-mixing because of leaking between plates, which may lead to hazardous conditions.

密封垫密封PEMFC堆栈，防止气体泄漏或混合，因为板之间的泄漏可能导致危险的情况。

The current collector plates conduct away the electrical current from the end anode to the corresponding end cathode via a load,  and in the process producing electrical power as shown in Fig. 1.

电流收集器板通过负载将电流从末端阳极传导到相应的末端阴极，并在此过程中产生如图1所示的电力。

The electrodes at the MEA are usually made of a gas diffusion layer consisting of carbon paper or cloth, and a catalyst layer consisting of catalysts such as Pt at the anode and Pt-Ru at the cathode, which are impregnated on carbon materials such as activated carbon (ACs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs)

MEA的电极通常由碳纸或碳布组成的气体扩散层和催化剂层组成，催化剂层包括阳极的Pt和阴极的Pt- ru，催化剂层浸渍在活性炭(ACs)、碳纳米管(CNTs)和碳纳米纤维(CNFs)等碳材料上。

The hydrogen oxidation reaction occurring at the anode in the presence of the Pt catalyst is given by:

Pt催化剂存在时，在阳极发生的氢氧化反应为:
$$
H_{2} \rightarrow 2 H^{+}+2 e^{-}
$$
The oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode in the presence of the Pt-Ru catalyst is given by

给出了Pt-Ru催化剂存在下阴极氧还原反应的过程
$$
4 \mathrm{H}^{+}+4 e^{-}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$
The overall reaction of the PEMFC is thus

PEMFC的整体反应是这样的
$$
2 \mathrm{H}_{2}+\mathrm{O}_{2}+\rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$
The proton exchange membrane or solid polymer electrolyte is usually a proton conducting polymer that is impermeable to gas and electron, such as perfluorosulfonic acid (PSFA) or Nafion, which is an excellent proton conductor that keeps gas crossover and electron short circuit to a minimum but its effective operating temperature is limited to 80-90 ?C.

质子交换膜或固体聚合物电解质通常是一种不渗透气体和电子的质子导电聚合物，如全氟磺酸(PSFA)或Nafion，它是一种优秀的质子导体，可以将气体交叉和电子短路保持在最低限度，但其有效工作温度限制在80-90℃。

The membrane conducts protons from the anode to the cathode to complete the electrical circuit with electrons that are conducted from the anode through the external load to the cathode, where both react with oxygen to form water.

薄膜将质子从阳极引导到阴极完成电路，电子从阳极通过外部负载传导到阴极，两者在阴极与氧气反应生成水。

Theoretically, a single fuel cell produces 1.23 V of electrical potential when in open circuit, but when connected to a load, it decreases as the load draws current from the cell and the usual operating voltage ranges from 0.6 to 0.7 V.

理论上，单个燃料电池在开路时产生1.23 V的电势，但当连接到负载时，随着负载从电池中吸取电流，电势下降，通常的工作电压范围为0.6 - 0.7 V。

The voltage loss is caused by several factors: activation polarization caused by slow electrochemical reactions at both the anode and the cathode, ohmic polarization losses caused by hydrogen crossover or electron short circuit through the membrane, mass transport polarization caused by hydrogen and oxygen concentration gradients at both electrodes when both reactants are consumed rapidly and ohmic losses caused by the internal resistance of the cell.

电压损失是由以下几个因素引起的:阳极和阴极缓慢的电化学反应引起的激活极化，氢交叉或电子通过膜短路引起的欧姆极化损失，当两种反应物都被快速消耗时，两个电极上氢和氧浓度梯度引起的质量输运极化以及电池内阻引起的欧姆损失。

![](.\PEMFC\polarization-curve-characteristic.png)

A larger total current can be drawn from the single fuel cell by increasing the effective area of the MEA.

通过增加MEA的有效面积，可以从单个燃料电池中获得更大的总电流。

### 4.PEM fuel cell system control

However, most applications of PEMFC system require higher voltage and current, or higher power than can be delivered by a  single fuel cell.

然而，PEMFC系统的大多数应用要求更高的电压和电流，或比单个燃料电池提供更高的功率。

Hence, in order to obtain a system with a higher power, multiple cells of PEMFC must be stacked together to form a PEMFC stack by attaching them in series to obtain a higher total voltage, and in parallel to obtain a larger total current.

因此，为了获得更高功率的系统，必须将PEMFC的多个单元串联在一起，形成PEMFC堆栈，通过串联来获得更高的总电压，并并联来获得更大的总电流。

Control strategies of the PEMFC system has to take into account of the main problems associated with harvesting electrical power from a PEMFC stack.

PEMFC系统的控制策略必须考虑到与从PEMFC堆栈收集电能相关的主要问题。

Polarization phenomena at all PEMFC electrodes in the stack reduces the voltage from the stack that can be delivered by the system whenever more current is drawn by the load, which may reduce the performance of the appliances or equipment that require fixed voltage for them to function properly.

当负载抽取更多电流时，堆栈中所有PEMFC电极上的极化现象降低了系统可以从堆栈中提供的电压，这可能会降低需要固定电压才能正常工作的电器或设备的性能。

Hence, the output voltage of the PEMFC stack must be controlled by either  manipulating hydrogen and air flow rate or boosting the voltage using outside means such as a battery or a super capacitor or both.

因此，PEMFC堆栈的输出电压必须通过操纵氢气和空气流速或使用外部手段(如电池或超级电容器或两者兼有)来控制。

Stacking also slows down fuel cell dynamics and at low temperature, it is difficult to start the PEMFC stack quickly, which is a phenomena called slow cold start

堆叠还会减慢燃料电池的动力学，在低温下，PEMFC堆叠很难快速启动，这是一种称为慢冷启动的现象

In addition, stacking multiple fuel cells together produces a larger heat of reaction that increases the temperature of the fuel cells, which if left uncontrolled may soften and ultimately destroy the membrane, a problem that does not exist in single fuel cells whose heat is removed sufficiently well by natural convection of ambient air.

此外，将多个燃料电池堆叠在一起会产生更大的反应热，从而提高燃料电池的温度，如果不加以控制，可能会软化并最终破坏膜，这是单个燃料电池不存在的问题，因为环境空气的自然对流可以很好地去除热量。

Moreover, hydrogen gas and air must be distributed evenly at the anodes and cathodes of individual cells at the same pressure and velocity to obtain uniform current and voltage at every individual cell, which cannot be achieved easily in PEMFC stacks unless due consideration is given to control it.

此外，氢气和空气必须以相同的压力和速度均匀地分布在各个单元的阳极和阴极上，以获得每个单元的均匀电流和电压，这在PEMFC堆栈中是不容易实现的，除非适当考虑控制它。

Furthermore, starting-up the fuel cell stack after shutting-down for a relatively long period may require purging of accumulated oxygen seeping through to the anodes from the atmosphere and mixing with hydrogen leftover from the previous cycle of operation, which may cause the occurrence of an abnormally high voltage at start-up that quickly degrades the anodes.

此外，在关闭一段相对较长的时间后启动燃料电池堆可能需要清除从大气中渗透到阳极的累积氧气，并与前一循环运行中剩余的氢混合，这可能会导致启动时出现异常高的电压，从而迅速降低阳极。

Since water is required to wet the membrane sufficiently during fuel cell stack operation in order to produce larger current and hence higher power, and water is also produced by electrochemical reaction at the cathodes, control of various humidification regimes of both hydrogen and air by recovery of excess water is required without flooding the electrodes with liquid water that reduces fuel cell stack performance

由于在燃料电池堆运行过程中，为了产生更大的电流，从而产生更高的功率，需要水来充分湿润膜，并且在阴极处的电化学反应也会产生水，因此需要通过回收多余的水来控制氢和空气的各种加湿制度，而不需要用液态水淹没电极，从而降低燃料电池堆的性能

#### 1.PEMFC system subsystems

he first control strategy of the PEMFC system is to improve electrochemical reactions in the stack effectively by manipulating or setting appropriate operating parameters such as humidity and flow rate of hydrogen and air and preventing fuel starvation, and stack temperature; and to improve stack durability by purging the anode at start-up thus preventing the occurrence of high start-up voltage that could damage the PEMFC stack.

PEMFC系统的第一控制策略是通过控制或设置适当的工作参数，如氢气和空气的湿度、流速和防止燃料饥饿，以及堆栈温度，有效地改善堆栈中的电化学反应;以及通过在启动时清洗阳极来提高堆栈持久性，从而防止可能损坏PEMFC堆栈的高启动电压的发生。

Secondly, the strategy is to ensure continuous operation at fixed system voltage output even when stack voltage drops when more current is drawn caused by polarization, by means of a battery or a super capacitor thus improving PEMFC system performance

其次，该策略是通过电池或超级电容器，在极化导致更多电流产生堆叠电压下降的情况下，确保在固定系统电压输出下持续工作，从而提高PEMFC系统性能

Generally, the PEMFC system can be broken down into at least 4 subsystems as shown in Fig 3.

通常，PEMFC系统可以被分解为至少4个子系统，如图3所示。

![](.\PEMFC\figure3.png)

```
1. Reaction subsystem.

2. Thermal subsystem.

3. Water management subsystem.

4. Power electronics subsystem.

1. 反应子系统。

2. 热子系统。

3.水管理子系统。

4. 电力电子子系统。
```

##### 1.Reaction subsystem

In the reaction subsystem, the reactants, hydrogen and air are fed to the PEMFC stack at a certain stoichiometric ratio, where they are reacted to generate electrical energy and water.

在反应子系统中，反应物、氢和空气以一定的化学计量比被送入PEMFC堆栈，在那里它们发生反应以产生电能和水。

Hydrogen is  supplied at the anode of the PEMFC using a fuel processor, usually a natural gas or methanol steam reformer that generates hydrogen from natural gas or methanol, or directly from pressurized hydrogen tank, where the outlet pressure of the PEMFC stack is controlled by a backpressure regulator at the PEMFC stack outlet.

氢在PEMFC的阳极使用燃料处理器供应，通常是天然气或甲醇蒸汽重整器，从天然气或甲醇产生氢，或直接从加压氢罐，其中PEMFC堆栈的出口压力由PEMFC堆栈出口的背压调节器控制。

On the other hand, air is supplied at the cathodes of the PEMFC stack using either a blower or a compressed air tank, where the inlet air pressure is controlled to deliver the required air flow rate at the specified hydrogen-air stoichiometric ratio.

另一方面，空气通过吹风机或压缩空气罐在PEMFC堆栈的阴极处供应，其中进口空气压力被控制，以指定的氢-空气化学计量比提供所需的空气流量。

However, determination of the hydrogen pressure at the PEMFC stack outlet and its flow rate, and the air supply inlet pressure and its flow rate are very complicated because higher hydrogen and air pressure increases the reaction kinetics of the electrochemical reactions, resulting in a higher power density and greater stack efficiency but a lower net available power from the PEMFC system because of higher parasitic power requirement.

然而，PEMFC堆栈出口氢气压力及其流量，以及供气入口压力及其流量的确定非常复杂，因为较高的氢气和空气压力会增加电化学反应的反应动力学，从而导致更高的功率密度和堆栈效率，但由于对寄生功率的要求较高，PEMFC系统的净可用功率较低。

Without adequate power in the PEMFC stack, a voltage drop will occur at the stack, resulting in a high current density that can damage the stack

如果PEMFC堆叠中没有足够的功率，PEMFC堆叠会产生压降，从而产生高电流密度，从而损坏堆叠

In addition, hydrogen and air are usually supplied at a fixed specified amount and a fixed stoichiometric ratio that is more than sufficient to generate the rated power of the PEMFC system.

此外，氢和空气通常以固定的指定量和固定的化学计量比供应，这足以产生PEMFC系统的额定功率。

However, the difficulty with fixed fuel-air management is its inability to follow the current and power variations of the PEMFC system because of varying load demands especially in automotive applications where changes in load demands are more frequent

然而，固定燃料-空气管理的难点在于，由于负载需求的变化，特别是在负载需求变化更频繁的汽车应用中，它无法跟踪PEMFC系统的电流和功率变化

This complex phenomenon may cause hydrogen starvation that can damage the fuel cell membrane and catalyst layer

这种复杂的现象可能会导致氢饥饿，从而破坏燃料电池膜和催化剂层

Hence, a more efficient hydrogen-air supply management system is required for better PEMFC system operation that increases efficiency of hydrogen usage and of the overall system.

因此，为了更好地运行PEMFC系统，提高氢气使用效率和整个系统的效率，需要一个更有效的氢气-空气供应管理系统。

##### 2.Thermal subsystem

Nearly half of the energy produced by the electrochemical reactions in PEMFC power generation is not electrical energy but heat of reaction.

PEMFC发电中电化学反应产生的能量有近一半不是电能而是反应热。

That is why thermal management subsystems deserve more attention because they play a crucial role in optimum PEMFC operation and prolonging its service lifetime.

因此，热管理子系统对于PEMFC的优化运行和延长使用寿命起着至关重要的作用。

Operating stack temperatures should be kept in the proper range in order to maintain optimum electrochemical reaction and keep the integrity of the PEMFC stack material.

为了保持最佳的电化学反应，保持PEMFC堆叠材料的完整性，工作堆栈温度应保持在适当的范围内。

Non-uniform temperature distributions may cause variations in the electrochemical reaction rates and affect the evaporation and condensation of water in the reactant gases.

不均匀的温度分布可能导致电化学反应速率的变化，并影响反应物气体中水的蒸发和凝结。

At higher temperatures, the PEMFC system performs better because the electrochemical reaction is faster as shown in Fig. 4.

如图4所示，在较高的温度下，PEMFC系统性能更好，因为电化学反应更快。

![](.\PEMFC\fig4.png)

However, if the temperature is too high, the membrane dehydrates, shrinks, wrinkles or ruptures.

然而，如果温度过高，薄膜就会脱水、收缩、起皱或破裂。

Since ohmic resistance of dry membranes is higher, the output voltage becomes lower.

干膜的欧姆电阻越大，输出电压越低。

In addition, damaged membranes may cause voltage to drop below the proper range, flooding the electrode and causing a drop in PEMFC performance and efficiency.

此外，损坏的膜可能会导致电压下降到适当的范围以下，淹没电极，导致PEMFC性能和效率下降。

Hence, a more effective and efficient thermal management subsystem has to be developed that maintains a uniform temperature distribution throughout the stack  and may reduce fuel consumption as well

因此，必须开发一个更有效和高效的热管理子系统，以保持整个堆栈的均匀温度分布，并可能降低燃料消耗

The main objective of a thermal management subsystem is to maintain the temperature in the optimum operating range and the moisture level in the stack and membrane.

热管理子系统的主要目标是将温度保持在最佳工作范围内，并保持栈和膜内的水分水平。

An example of a thermal management system for PEMFC is given in Fig.

图中给出了PEMFC热管理系统的一个例子。

![](.\PEMFC\thermal-system.png)

In low temperature PEMFC system, the heat is more than sufficient to keep the electrochemical reaction running at a high enough temperature of up to 90 ?C

在低温PEMFC系统中，热量足以使电化学反应在高达90℃的足够高的温度下运行

The best operating temperature for low temperature PEMFCs is in the range of 65 ?C-85 ?C

低温pemfc的最佳工作温度为65℃-85℃

On the other hand, in high temperature PEMFC system, the heat can be recovered to heat water or air but its temperature of 120-140 ?C is not high enough to raise steam in a heat recovery boiler for cogeneration like in higher temperature SOFC systems.

另一方面，在高温PEMFC系统中，热量可以回收用于加热水或空气，但其120-140℃的温度不足以像高温SOFC系统那样在热回收锅炉中提高蒸汽进行热电联产。

Temperatures of  small PEMFC stacks of up to 1500 W can be controlled sufficiently by removing the heat using a simple air cooling system that also doubles as an air supply system through the cathode, while those of higher power stacks have to be controlled by a closed water cooling system with a radiator that can handle the higher heat load

小型PEMFC堆栈的温度高达1500w，可以通过使用简单的空气冷却系统(同时也是通过阴极的空气供应系统)来去除热量来充分控制，而大功率堆栈的温度必须由带有散热器的封闭水冷却系统来控制，该散热器可以处理更高的热负荷

##### 3.Water management subsystem

Water facilitates proton transport mechanism through the membrane and the catalyst layers of the MEA and is also produced by the electrochemical reaction at the catalyst layer in the cathode of the PEMFC.

水促进质子通过MEA的膜和催化剂层的传输机制，也由PEMFC阴极中催化剂层的电化学反应产生。

The membrane must be kept saturated with moisture to ensure higher membrane conductivity and better membrane stability, and to prevent membrane from drying out.

膜必须保持水分饱和，以保证较高的膜导电性和更好的膜稳定性，并防止膜干燥。

However, too much water must be removed to prevent flooding and polarization loss

然而，为了防止水淹和极化损失，必须去除太多的水

**Water flooding** increases at low air flow rate because of the slower mass transfer of water produced by the electrochemical reaction into the air

由于电化学反应产生的水向空气中的传质速度较慢，水驱在空气流速较低时增大

![](.\PEMFC\futransparent-fuel-cell.png)

Likewise flooding increases at low temperature because of the slower water evaporation rate

同样，由于水蒸发速度较慢，在低温下洪水也会增加

Flooding is also affected by reduction of **GDL** porosity by liquid water

洪水也受到液态水降低GDL孔隙率的影响

Even very small amounts of liquid water in the gas flow field and GDL affects PEMFC performance dramatically

即使在气体流场和GDL中存在非常少量的液态水，也会极大地影响PEMFC的性能

Fluid flow regime in the flow field and GDL at the cathode becomes two-phase flow when there is condensation of water vapour

当有水蒸气凝结时，阴极的流场和GDL中的流体流动制度成为两相流

Humidity of the reactant gases can also be manipulated to prevent flooding

还可以控制反应物气体的湿度以防止水浸

Hence, an effective and more efficient water management system prevents flooding but also  maintains membrane humidity for a better PEMFC performance.

因此，有效和更高效的水管理系统可以防止水淹，但也可以保持膜湿度，以获得更好的PEMFC性能。

The main roles of water management systems for PEMFC are to ensure adequate water use and to maintain membrane hydration.

PEMFC水管理系统的主要作用是确保足够的水利用和维持膜水化。

There are two main approach of water management for PEMFC stacks: external and internal humidification.

PEMFC堆栈的水管理有两种主要方法:外部加湿和内部加湿。

In external humidification systems, the humidity of reactant gases is controlled by manipulating the humidification temperature and the contact time of reactant gases with water in the external humidifier

在外部加湿系统中，通过控制外部加湿器中的加湿温度和反应气与水的接触时间来控制反应气的湿度

I n internal humidification systems, water is injected directly into the PEMFC to maintain the hydration level of the membrane and to ensure that the moisture content of the membrane is within the proper range

在内部加湿系统中，水直接注入PEMFC，以维持膜的水化水平，并确保膜的含水量在适当的范围内

Relative humidity (RH) sensors used to detect water throughout the cathode fails to detect liquid water

相对湿度(RH)传感器用于检测整个阴极的水，无法检测到液态水

Various Fuzzy logic control of humidity using a fan in Fig. 7 instead of the normal feedback control apparently improves water management

用图7中的风机代替正常的反馈控制，对湿度进行各种模糊逻辑控制，明显改善了水的管理

##### 4.Power management subsystem

Power management subsystems are used to control the flow of electric power from unstable power sources via electronic power devices that process, filter, and deliver the electricity efficiently and smoothly.

电源管理子系统用于通过电子电源设备控制来自不稳定电源的电力流，该电子电源设备可以有效、顺利地处理、过滤和输送电力。

Factors such as cost, efficiency, electrical isolation to protect overload, and ripple-free and reliable operation determine the type of power management subsystem to be used

成本、效率、保护过载的电气隔离以及无波纹和可靠的运行等因素决定了要使用的电源管理子系统的类型

Typical voltage of PEMFC stacks currently in the market is 25-50 V, which drops when high currents are drawn during higher load demands because of polarization and ohmic losses.

目前市场上PEMFC堆栈的典型电压为25-50 V，由于极化和欧姆损失，当在更高的负载要求下产生大电流时，电压会下降。

Hence, the unstable direct current (DC) power generated from PEMFC stacks has to be controlled by power management subsystems that deliver sufficient power from the PEMFC to the load and control the electric power output to satisfy load demands in terms of voltage, current, power quality, and transients.

因此，由PEMFC堆叠产生的不稳定直流(DC)电力必须由电源管理子系统控制，由PEMFC向负载提供足够的电力，并控制输出电力以满足负载在电压、电流、电能质量和瞬态方面的需求。

Many different control strategies have been implemented in power management subsystem of PEMFC systems to improve the latter's performance.

为了提高PEMFC系统的性能，在其电源管理子系统中采用了多种不同的控制策略。

Voltage regulators, DC/DC converters and chopper circuits are used to regulate the voltage at fixed values higher or lower than the stack operating voltage.

电压调节器、DC/DC变换器和斩波电路用于将电压调节到高于或低于堆叠工作电压的固定值。

A simple power electronic subsystem consists of an adjustable external circuit to control the power output using a rheostat, a metaleoxideesemiconductor field-effect transistor  (MOSFET), or a DC/DC converter

一个简单的电力电子子系统由一个可调节的外部电路组成，通过变阻器、金属氧化物半导体场效应晶体管(MOSFET)或DC/DC转换器控制功率输出

Since most consumer applications require alternating current (AC), the power electronic subsystems also have an inverter to convert the DC from the PEMFC stack into AC using a single-stage DC/AC inverter topology or a combination of a DC/DC converter in series with DC/AC inverter for multistage conversion, as shown in Fig. 8.

由于大多数消费者应用需要交流电(AC)，电力电子子系统也有一个逆变器，使用单级DC/AC逆变器拓扑将PEMFC堆栈的DC转换为AC，或将DC/DC变换器与DC/AC逆变器串联组合，进行多级转换，如图8所示。

![](.\PEMFC\figure8-Configuration of power management for fuel cell system.png)

### 5.Fuel starvation control

The main issue to be addressed in this review that has not been adequately addressed by previous reviews on PEMFC system control , is how to avoid fuel (hydrogen) and oxidant (air or oxygen) starvation when the partial pressures of both gases drop to below the critical levels, especially during fast transient loading when higher fuel flow to the anode and cathode cannot be affected quickly enough to replace fast depleting hydrogen and oxygen adequately and evenly throughout the stack because of their fixed stoichiometric ratio and flow rates or slow control action of highly non-linear PEMFC dynamics

本文要解决的主要问题是，当两种气体的分压降至临界水平以下时，如何避免燃料(氢)和氧化剂(空气或氧气)的饥饿，这是先前关于PEMFC系统控制的综述没有充分解决的问题。特别是在快速瞬态加载期间，由于其固定的化学计量比和流速或高度非线性PEMFC动力学的缓慢控制作用，较高的燃料流向阳极和阴极的流量不能迅速影响到足够快地在整个堆栈中充分和均匀地替代快速消耗的氢和氧

Fuel starvation of individual cells in the stack caused by uneven flow of hydrogen and oxygen reduces the voltage of the fuel starved cells and consequently reduce the overall stack potential as well.

由氢和氧的不均匀流动引起的堆栈中单个电池的燃料短缺降低了燃料短缺电池的电压，从而降低了整个堆栈的潜力。

More seriously, polarity reversal may also occur when oxygen or hydrogen starvation generates hydrogen in the cathode and oxygen in the anode respectively, which causes corrosion of carbon components such as the gas diffusion and backing layers, followed by corrosion of electro-catalysts or burns at the catalyst layers of the electrodes and on the membrane surface

更严重的是，当氧气或缺氢在阴极和阳极分别产生氢气和氧气时，还可能发生极性反转，从而导致气体扩散层和衬底层等碳成分的腐蚀，进而导致电极的催化剂层和膜表面的催化剂层腐蚀或燃烧

Thus, fuel starvation leads to performance degradation, damage of electrode surface and shorter catalyst life

因此，燃料短缺会导致电极性能下降、电极表面损伤和催化剂寿命缩短

In the past, a common method of fuel supply control to increase the PEMFC's net power and reduce the possibility of fuel starvation is by using more fuel than needed for the specified power.

在过去，一种常用的燃料供应控制方法，以增加PEMFC的净功率和减少燃料短缺的可能性是使用更多的燃料超过所需的指定功率。

Flow rates of both hydrogen and oxygen are controlled at fixed excess ratios (stoichiometric ratios) to their minimum flow rates that are required for maintaining the desired current density

氢气和氧气的流量都控制在固定的过剩比率(化学计量比)，以保持所需的电流密度所需的最小流量

PEMFC power increases when oxygen stoichiometric ratio is raised because more oxygen is available for reaction as shown in Fig .9 , but starts to level out when the stoichiometric ratio goes beyond 6 because more liquid water starts to form and mass transfer begins to limit the rate of oxygen reaching the catalyst as shown in both Fig.

如图9所示，当氧化学计量比提高时，PEMFC功率增加，因为有更多的氧可用于反应，但当化学计量比超过6时，PEMFC功率开始趋于平稳，因为更多的液态水开始形成，传质开始限制氧气到达催化剂的速度，如图9所示。

![](.\PEMFC\figure9-voltage plotting at different condition.png)

However, avoiding oxygen starvation by increasing oxygen stoichiometric ratio also increases power consumption of the air compressor thus increasing parasitic losses and lowers the net power gained by the higher oxygen stoichiometric ratio

然而，通过提高氧化学计量比避免缺氧也增加了空压机的功耗，从而增加了寄生损失，降低了由较高的氧化学计量比获得的净功率

Optimum operating stoichiometric ratios that improve PEMFC efficiency, prevent fuel cell damage and increase its durability have been found to lie between 1.1 and 1.5 for hydrogen and between 2 and 2.4 for oxygen

研究发现，提高PEMFC效率、防止燃料电池损坏和提高耐久性的最佳运行化学计量比为氢气在1.1 - 1.5之间，氧气在2 - 2.4之间

Stack orientation also improves PEMFC performance but is not practical to be used for PEMFC control

堆栈朝向也可以提高PEMFC性能，但用于PEMFC控制并不实用

In addition, periodic urging of spent hydrogen  also helps to improve PEMFC performance by removing excess liquid water accumulating at the anode

此外，周期性的废氢催促也有助于通过去除在阳极积聚的多余液态水来提高PEMFC性能

##### Control strategies for avoidance of fuel starvation

A variety of control strategies have been implemented in PEMFC systems in order to avoid hydrogen and oxygen starvation.

在PEMFC系统中已经实施了各种控制策略，以避免氢和氧的饥饿。

A summary of the control strategies is given in Table 1.

表1概述了控制策略。

![](.\PEMFC\table1-volume one.png)

![](.\PEMFC\table1-volume two.png)

Most of the control strategies could be easily implemented by using software LabVIEW, which is commonly used for data logging to provide precise data acquisition and for converting analog inputs into digital outputs for field point measurements

大多数控制策略可以通过使用LabVIEW软件轻松实现，该软件通常用于数据记录，以提供精确的数据采集，并将模拟输入转换为数字输出，用于现场点测量

###### Classical feedback and feed-forward control using proportional integral derivative control

Classical feedback and feed-forward control with proportional integral derivatives controllers (PID) is the most common type of control used to obtain better fuel cell performance

经典的反馈和前馈控制与比例积分导数控制器(PID)是最常用的控制类型用于获得更好的燃料电池性能

In feedback control, the control variable is measured and compared with its desired value or set-point and the error is fed back into the system via the action of the manipulated variable that is commonly also a downstream variable, which is proportional to the error (proportional, P), the sum of recent errors (integral, I) and the rate of change of the error (derivative, D)

在反馈控制中，控制变量被测量并与其期望值或设定值进行比较，误差通过被操纵变量(通常也是下游变量)的作用反馈到系统中，该变量与误差(比例，P)、最近误差的总和(积分，I)和误差的变化率(导数，D)成正比。

In feed-forward control, the error is fed via a manipulated variable that is also an upstream variable so that anticipated disturbance of the upstream variable to the system is compensated beforehand.

The architectures of the classical feedback and feed-forward control with PID controller is shown in Fig. 10.

在前馈控制中，误差是通过一个被操纵的变量(也是上游变量)来传递的，因此上游变量对系统的预期扰动事先得到补偿。

带PID控制器的经典反馈前馈控制体系结构如图10所示。

![](.\PEMFC\figure10-Architecture of a feedback and feed-forward control.png)

Feedback control of current output using PID controllers by manipulating air pressure or stoichiometric ratio has been used satisfactorily as a single input single output (SISO) control system

采用PID控制器通过控制气压或化学计量比对电流输出进行反馈控制，作为单输入单输出(SISO)控制系统得到了较好的应用

However, feedback control of output current using a PID controller by manipulating hydrogen stoichiometric ratio has been shown to be faster in responding to power demand in dead end PEMFCs than by manipulating oxygen or air stoichiometric ratio

然而，使用PID控制器通过操纵氢化学计量比来反馈控制输出电流已被证明比操纵氧或空气化学计量比更快地响应死端pemfc中的功率需求

Feedback PID control of voltage by manipulating either air stoichiometric ratio or oxygen partial pressure and of air-hydrogen pressure difference by manipulating hydrogen stoichiometry in a decentralized multi input multi output (MIMO) control system have been shown to have the best controllability indices compared to other control-manipulated variables pairs

在分散多输入多输出(MIMO)控制系统中，通过控制空气化学计量比或氧气分压来控制电压的反馈PID控制，以及通过控制氢气化学计量来控制空气-氢气压差的反馈PID控制，与其他控制变量对相比，具有最好的可控性指标

However, since manipulating oxygen partial pressure is not practical, it is preferable that voltage control is by manipulating air stoichiometric ratio.

然而，由于操纵氧气分压是不实际的，最好是通过操纵空气化学计量比来控制电压。

Since the response time of the voltage is significantly slower than that of the current because of the presence of a time delay in voltage dynamic, the air flow or stoichiometric ratio required to produce the current demand is feed-forward controlled using a PI controller in an inner loop for a quicker system response, while the voltage is feedback controlled using a PI controller in an outer loop to compensate the air stoichiometric ratio control for drop in voltage as a result of the rise in current as shown in Fig 11.

由于电压动态中存在时间延迟，电压的响应时间明显比电流的响应时间慢，产生电流需求所需的空气流量或化学计量比使用内环中的PI控制器进行前馈控制，以获得更快的系统响应。而电压则通过外环的PI控制器进行反馈控制，以补偿空气化学计量比控制中由于电流上升而导致的电压下降，如图所示。

![](.\PEMFC\figure11 -Block diagram of PI feedback voltage control and feed-forward current control of a small PEMFC system.png)

On the other hand, in PEMFC systems where the hydrogen is supplied not from a compressed tank but directly from a fuel processor unit using natural gas, a MIMO control system where the hydrogen level in the fuel cell anode and temperature of the catalytic partial oxidation are controlled by manipulating the natural gas and humidified air flows respectively, are found to be superior to decentralized MIMO control or separate SISO controls of hydrogen and air flows

另一方面，在PEMFC系统中，氢气不是从压缩罐，而是直接从使用天然气的燃料处理器单元提供，MIMO控制系统中，燃料电池阳极中的氢气水平和催化部分氧化的温度分别通过操纵天然气和湿化空气流动来控制，被发现优于分散MIMO控制或单独的氢气和空气流动的SISO控制

Alternatively, the power or current is feedback controlled by manipulating hydrogen flow rate and oxygen starvation is prevented by ratio controlling the air flow rate so that the oxygen flow rate is always changing at a fixed ratio to the hydrogen flow rate

或者，通过操纵氢气流速来反馈控制功率或电流，通过控制空气流速来防止氧气饥饿，从而使氧气流速与氢气流速始终以固定比例变化。

######  Adaptive control (AC)

Although conventional feed-forward and feedback using the classical PID control were often used to prevent oxygen starvation because of their simplicity and low cost , the nonlinear, complex and slow PEMFC dynamics associated with fuel  starvation requires control strategies that can respond faster and more accurately.

尽管传统的前馈和反馈使用经典的PID控制，由于其简单和低成本，经常被用来防止氧饥饿，但与燃料饥饿相关的非线性、复杂和缓慢的PEMFC动态需要控制策略，可以更快和更准确地响应。

Response time of the air stoichiometry control to transient load changes was improved by using a conventional feed-forward control of the output PEMFC current together with a sliding mode (feedback) control (SMC) of the oxygen stoichiometric ratio as shown in Fig. 12, which is a modified feedback “PID control” that quickly forces the stoichiometric ratio error to reach and then to remain on its sliding surface, which represents the desired nonlinear dynamic of the PEMFC stack; and finally to rapidly reach its stable condition smoothly

如图12所示，通过使用输出PEMFC电流的传统前馈控制和氧气化学计量比率的滑动模式（反馈）控制（SMC），改善了空气化学计量控制对瞬态负载变化的响应时间，这是一种改进的反馈 "PID控制"，它能迅速迫使化学计量比率误差达到并保持在其滑动表面上，这代表了PEMFC堆的理想非线性动态；最后迅速平稳地达到其稳定状态。

![](.\PEMFC\figure12-structure of SMC.png)

In the SMC and feed forward control, the recovery of oxygen stoichiometry towards the desired reference under step load changes improved from 500 ms to 30 ms, due to the joint contribution of the feed forward controller and SMC as shown in Fig13.

在SMC和前馈控制中，由于前馈控制器和SMC的共同贡献，在阶梯负荷变化下，氧气化学计量向理想参考值的恢复从500ms提高到30ms，如图13所示。

![](.\PEMFC\figure13-SMC controller performance.png)

Response time of oxygen stoichiometry can also be improved by  an early adaptive PID control called the self-tuning PID feedback control as shown in Fig. 14, where the non-linear dynamics is handled by continuously retuning the control constants to adapt to varying dynamic parameters  (see Fig. 15).

氧气化学计量的响应时间也可以通过早期的自适应PID控制来改善，如图14所示，自调整PID反馈控制，其中非线性动态是通过不断重新调整控制常数来适应变化的动态参数（见图15）。

![](.\PEMFC\figure14-structure of a self-tuning PID.png)

![](.\PEMFC\figure15-自调谐PID控制器和传统PID对引起电压阶跃变化的负载需求的反应.png)

In Fig. 14 a self-tuning PID controller whose integral and derivative parameters were automatically estimated by ZieglereNichols method, used to control the voltage of a PEMFC stack, was able to ride smoothly to a step change of voltage setpoint and achieved a steady value within 5 s, while a conventional PID air stoichiometry controller suffered a significant dip in voltage for the same step change of voltage before recovering due to the sudden voltage loss because of fuel starvation during step change in load demand and could not achieve a steady state within the same period.

在图14中，一个自调谐PID控制器，其积分和导数参数是通过Zieglere-Nichols方法自动估计的，用于控制PEMFC堆的电压，能够平稳地驾驭电压设定点的阶跃变化，并在5秒内达到稳定值，而传统的PID空气节制器在相同的电压阶跃变化中，由于在负载需求阶跃变化中燃料饥饿导致的突然电压损失，在恢复之前遭受了明显的电压下降，无法在同一期间达到稳定状态。

Despite the apparent effectiveness self-tuning PID control in identifying control parameters to adapt to changing system dynamics, it is still slower and inherently inaccurate or off-setted over time

尽管自调PID控制在确定控制参数以适应不断变化的系统动态方面明显有效，但它仍然较慢，并且随着时间的推移，固有的不准确或偏移。

To solve the offset problem, adaptive control is implemented where parameters of the process model and of the control law are continually estimated and updated

为了解决偏移问题，实施了自适应控制，其中过程模型和控制法的参数被不断地估计和更新。

In order to do this, parameter estimation of non-linear and linear models of the PEMFC using robust parameter identification techniques have been developed

为了做到这一点，利用稳健的参数识别技术对PEMFC的非线性和线性模型进行了参数估计。

The simplest implementation of adaptive control to prevent oxygen starvation is adaptive air stoichiometric ratio control whose parameters are estimated using a close-loop least square parameter identification algorithm and assignment of closed-loop poles in real-time

防止氧饥饿的自适应控制的最简单实现是自适应空气化学计量比控制，其参数是通过闭环最小平方参数识别算法和实时分配闭环极点来估计的。

The simple adaptive control of oxygen stoichiometry alone may not be sufficient to avoid oxygen starvation if no constraint is put on  the lowest oxygen stoichiometric ratio below which starvation occurs. To ensure that oxygen stoichiometric ratio limit for starvation is not violated, and at the same time the output current is tracking the demand current as closely as possible in an adaptive manner, a load governor is added on to the conventional feedforward control of output current and feedback control of output voltage that tracks the output current and strictly enforce the starvation limit as shown in Fig16.

如果不对发生饿死的最低氧气化学计量比进行约束，仅靠简单的氧气化学计量自适应控制可能不足以避免氧气饿死。为了确保不违反饥饿的氧计量比限制，同时输出电流以自适应的方式尽可能地跟踪需求电流，在传统的输出电流前馈控制和输出电压反馈控制上增加了一个负载调节器，跟踪输出电流并严格执行饥饿限制，如图所示。

![](.\PEMFC\figure16.png)

Responses of robust and nominal load governors to a step change in current demand. The robust load governor tracks the output current and enforce fuel starvation restrictions successfully

稳健型和额定负载调速器对电流需求的阶跃变化的反应。稳健型负载调速器跟踪输出电流，并成功地执行了燃料饥饿限制。

An adaptive control of a PEMFC powered car using extremum seeking control (ESC) has been shown to be able to optimize hydrogen fuel utilization successfully by steering control action to ensure minimum fuel utilization at sufficiently high oxygen stoichiometric ratio of more than 2 that prevents oxygen starvation

使用极值寻求控制(ESC)的PEMFC动力汽车的自适应控制已被证明能够通过转向控制动作成功地优化氢燃料的利用，以确保在足够高的氧化学计量比超过2的情况下最低的燃料利用率，从而防止氧气饥饿

###### Model predictive control

Whenever a well validated non-linear model of the PEMFC is available [11 1], it can be used to update control action of the air flow rate in a constrained feed-forward model predictive control (MPC) of current demand by comparing the actual and predicted output current, reducing the error and limit the oxygen stoichiometric ratio above starvation

只要PEMFC有一个经过良好验证的非线性模型，它就可以通过比较实际输出电流和预测输出电流，在电流需求的约束前馈模型预测控制(MPC)中更新空气流量的控制动作，减少误差并限制饥饿以上的氧气化学计量比

The MPC is also successfully used for feed-forward control of current demand for maximum power efficiency and output voltage by manipulating the air flow rate

MPC还通过控制空气流量成功地用于前馈控制电流需求以获得最大功率效率和输出电压

However, since the MPC of non-linear systems requires considerable computational time because of its implicit non-linear nature, a linearized form of the model is used instead in an explicit constrained predictive control system that reduces computational time and responds faster for either feed-forward control of current demand for maximum efficiency and starvation control or feedback voltage tracking by manipulating air flow rate as shown in Fig 17.

然而，由于非线性系统的MPC由于其隐含的非线性性质需要相当多的计算时间，因此在显式约束预测控制系统中使用模型的线性化形式，该系统减少了计算时间，并且对电流需求的最大效率和饥饿控制的前馈控制或通过操纵气流速率的反馈电压跟踪响应更快，如图17所示。

![](.\PEMFC\figure17.png)

In addition, the oxygen starvation control of current demand has also been implemented by using an MPC that not only feed-forward control the current demand by manipulating air flow rate but also the state of charge of a super capacitor in a hybrid fuel cell and super capacitor system

此外，在混合燃料电池和超级电容器系统中，采用MPC不仅通过控制空气流速前馈控制电流需求，还通过控制超级电容器的电荷状态实现了缺氧电流需求控制

###### Neural network control

Instead of expending long computational time to identify the parameters of a linearized model of a non-linear system in order to know the response of output variables to changes in the input variables in MPCs, system output responses to input disturbances can be learned by an intelligent system called the artificial neural network (ANN) or simply neural network (NN), where the NN is trained by inpu	t-output data of the non-linear system and the weights are determined by a back-propagation of errors technique.

An NN has been used to model successfully the non-linear system of a fuel cell system for vehicles using multi-layered perceptrons, which could be used to control the fuel cell system in a Neural Network Control (NNC) system

为了知道mpc中输出变量对输入变量变化的响应，不需要花费很长的计算时间来识别非线性系统的线性化模型的参数，系统对输入扰动的输出响应可以被称为人工神经网络(ANN)或简单地称为神经网络(NN)的智能系统学习。其中神经网络由非线性系统的输入输出数据训练，权重由误差反向传播技术确定。

利用神经网络对汽车燃料电池系统的多层感知器进行非线性建模，并将其应用于神经网络控制(NNC)系统的燃料电池控制

An optimized NNC called  the neural optimal control (NOC) of current demand by manipulating hydrogen and air flow rates, whose NN is the parametric cerebellar model articulation controller (P-CMAC) network as shown in Fig. 18, which has two different weights; long term memory trained offline and short term memory trained online, shows better performance than conventional PI control as shown in Fig.

一种通过操纵氢气和空气流量的优化NNC称为当前需求的神经最优控制(NOC)，其NN为参数化小脑模型关节控制器(P-CMAC)网络，如图18所示，具有两个不同的权重;离线训练的长期记忆和在线训练的短期记忆，表现出比传统PI控制更好的性能，如图所示 19。

![](.\PEMFC\figure18.png)

![](.\PEMFC\figure19.png)

Control of current demand of a PEMFC system by manipulating the hydrogen flow rate and using a variation of the NN called dynamic neural network (DNN) that learns continuously, has been shown to be superior in performance to PI only control as shown in

通过操纵氢流量和使用一种称为动态神经网络(DNN)的神经网络的变化来控制PEMFC系统的电流需求，已被证明在性能上优于PI仅控制，如图所示

![](.\PEMFC\figure20.png)

(a)动态神经网络(DNN)通过操纵氢流量控制电力需求的响应;(b)氢流量控制以防止燃料短缺

###### Fuzzy logic control

Fuzzy logic control (FLC) has now become an important process control technique used in controlling air and hydrogen flow rates in fuel cells because it can use simple rules or heuristics from human experts to control the complex non-linear processes of the fuel cell without having to understand the process completely

模糊逻辑控制(FLC)目前已成为一种重要的过程控制技术，用于控制燃料电池中的空气和氢气流量，因为它可以使用简单的规则或人类专家的启发式方法来控制燃料电池复杂的非线性过程，而无需完全理解该过程

Introduced in the 60s, fuzzy logic converts partial or approximate reasoning of the logical states of intervals of traditional or crisp variables by a process called fuzzification, into logical values that range continuously from 1 to 0 (partially true to partially false) called fuzzy sets instead of just either 1 (true) or 0 (false) only as in the conventional binomial Boolean sets

20世纪60年代引入的模糊逻辑将传统或清晰变量区间逻辑状态的部分或近似推理通过一种称为模糊化的过程转换为范围从1到0(部分真到部分假)的连续逻辑值，称为模糊集，而不是仅像传统的二项式布尔集那样只有1(真)或0(假)

Instead of rectangular blocks representing abrupt changes of Boolean sets as functions of the true or false states of intervals of crisp variables, the partially true and partially false states of the crisp variable intervals are represented by triangles or trapeziums called membership functions whose sides represent the continuously changing values or degrees of membership of fuzzy sets as shown in Fig.

将表示布尔集突变的矩形块表示为crisp变量区间的真或假状态的函数，而将crisp变量区间的部分真和部分假状态表示为称为隶属函数的三角形或梯形，其边表示模糊集的连续变化值或隶属度，如图所示。

![](.\PEMFC\figure21.png)

In FLC, both the output and input crisp variables of a control problem are fuzzified into fuzzy sets by incorporating as many as possible linguistically fuzzy information from human experts or from observation of system behavior via modeling or actual experiments, and control is obtained by using the IF THEN causal rules between any number of input fuzzy sets that have been averaged and weighted, and the output fuzzy set, which is then defuzzified back to the crisp output variable to affect the actual control action [18,1 14]. The structure of an FLC is shown in Fig.

在FLC中，控制问题的输出和输入crisp变量通过结合来自人类专家或通过建模或实际实验观察到的系统行为的尽可能多的语言模糊信息，模糊化为模糊集，并使用任意数量的已平均加权的输入模糊集与输出模糊集之间的IF THEN因果规则来获得控制。然后将其解模糊回到清晰的输出变量，以影响实际的控制动作[18,1 14]。FLC结构如图所示。

Hence FLCs are simple and cheap to implement by simply validating rule bases against real time results with existing controllers

因此，flc的实现简单而廉价，只需根据现有控制器的实时结果验证规则库

In addition it does not need accurate mathematical models with heavy computing costs [123], are nonlinear and adaptive in nature, have little overshoot [1 15] and offer robust performance when there are variations in parameters and load disturbances

此外，它不需要计算成本高的精确数学模型[123]，具有非线性和自适应性质，超调量小[1 15]，在参数变化和负载扰动时具有鲁棒性能

FLC of air flow rate as shown in Fig. 23 has very much smaller momentary power drop and significant less overshoot during step change of current demand than the model-based predictive PID control of air stoichiometry as shown in Fig. 24 .

FLC's control of air supply has also been embedded under supervisory FLC in a hierarchical hybrid control of an on-line fuel cell power management system . In addition, FLC has also been used to balance the power sharing between fuel cells and battery  or supercapacitor  in hybrid power systems in order to improve the efficiency and lifetime of the battery or supercapacitor, decrease fuel consumption and prevent inadequate humidification of the fuel cell due to flooding or gas starvation.

FLC对空气供应的控制也被嵌入到监督FLC的在线燃料电池电源管理系统的分层混合控制中。此外，FLC还被用于平衡混合动力系统中燃料电池和电池或超级电容器之间的功率共享，以提高电池或超级电容器的效率和寿命，降低燃料消耗，防止燃料电池因水浸或气体饥饿而湿度不足。

###### FLC & PID

FLCs have also been coupled with PID controllers to improve fuel  cell performance . FLC-PI control of voltage output of the fuel cell by manipulating the set-point of both the hydrogen and air mass flow rate to maintain constant output voltage was found to be far superior to PI control only, because the former is capable of raising the polarization curve and therefore increasing the performance of the fuel cell via. Alternatively, double loop FLCPI control of both voltage and current outputs by manipulating the set-points of the air and hydrogen mass flow rate respectively have been shown to be far superior to conventional PI control, because the former can handle non-linear processes better  the control interface are as shown in Fig. 25.

flc还与PID控制器相结合，以提高燃料电池的性能。FLC-PI控制燃料电池的电压输出，通过操纵氢气和空气质量流量的设定值来保持恒定的输出电压，被发现远优于PI控制，因为前者能够提高极化曲线，从而提高燃料电池的性能。另外，通过分别控制空气和氢气质量流量的设定值来控制电压和电流输出的双环FLCPI控制已被证明远优于传统的PI控制，因为前者可以更好地处理非线性过程，控制界面如图25所示。

### 6.conclution

PEMFC system control has long been implemented only on the power electronics subsystem, where any drop in voltage of the PEMFC as a result of higher current or power demand is compensated simply by boosting it using either a battery or a super capacitor

长期以来，PEMFC系统控制仅在电力电子子系统上实现，在电力电子子系统中，由于更高的电流或功率需求而导致的PEMFC电压下降，只需使用电池或超级电容器进行增压即可补偿

Since recent evidence has shown that fuel starvation is the real cause of the voltage drop, which could also damage the PEMFC by the occurrence of polarity reversals, many researchers have also included fuel starvation prevention in their PEMFC system control.

由于最近的证据表明，燃料短缺是电压下降的真正原因，电压下降也可能通过极性反转的发生而损坏PEMFC，因此许多研究人员也将防止燃料短缺纳入PEMFC系统控制中。

Hence, the focus of the review is on PEMFC system control strategies that avoid fuel starvation. Classical proportional integral and derivative (PID) controllers are commonly used in feedback voltage control and feed-forward current control by manipulating hydrogen and air flow rate.

因此，研究的重点是避免燃料短缺的PEMFC系统控制策略。经典的比例积分微分(PID)控制器通常用于控制氢气和空气流量的反馈电压控制和前馈电流控制。

However, PID controllers suffer from two major drawbacks: inaccurate control because of control variable's offset and slow response time.

然而，PID控制器存在两大缺点:控制变量偏移导致的控制不准确和响应时间慢。

Self-tuning PID controllers or the sliding mode controllers (SMC) have been used solve the problem by adapting to the changing dynamics and responding faster.

自整定PID控制器或滑模控制器(SMC)通过对动态变化的适应和快速响应来解决这一问题。

Adaptive controllers (AC) that estimate parameters of the non-linear and linear models of the PEMFC, and update control action continuously including the more complex adaptive control using a load governor and extremum seeking controller (ESC) are able track the load more closely.

自适应控制器(AC)可以估计PEMFC的非线性和线性模型的参数，并不断更新控制动作，包括使用负载调节器和极值寻求控制器(ESC)的更复杂的自适应控制，能够更紧密地跟踪负载。

Further improvement of fuel starvation control has been made by using model predictive control (MPC), where a validated model of the PEMFC is used to predict system behavior which can then be used to update controller action

通过使用模型预测控制(MPC)进一步改进了燃油饥饿控制，其中PEMFC的验证模型用于预测系统行为，然后可用于更新控制器动作

The use of artificial intelligence in PEMFC system control to avoid fuel starvation, such as neural network control (NNC) and fuzzy logic control (FLC) has been implemented successfully recently because they are simpler and cheaper to implement without heavy computational burden of the AC and MPC but produce better results.

人工智能在PEMFC系统控制中的应用，如神经网络控制(NNC)和模糊逻辑控制(FLC)，由于其实现简单，成本低，没有AC和MPC的计算负担，但效果更好，近年来已成功实现。
